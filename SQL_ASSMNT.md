- Section 5: 5 Marks Questions
- 1.Create a trigger to log changes to the artworks table into an artworks_log table,
  capturing the artwork_id, title, and a change description.

```sql
CREATE TABLE artworks_log (
    log_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    artwork_id INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    change_description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL);

GO
CREATE TRIGGER artworks_change_log
AFTER UPDATE ON artworks

BEGIN
    INSERT INTO artworks_log (artwork_id, title, change_description)
    VALUES (OLD.artwork_id, OLD.title, CONCAT('Updated to: ', NEW.title));
END;
```

- 2.Create a scalar function to calculate the average sales amount for artworks in a given genre and write a query to use this function for 'Impressionism'.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION averageSalesAmount(genre VARCHAR(50)) RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)
BEGIN
    DECLARE avg_sales_amount DECIMAL(10,2);
    SELECT AVG(sales.total_amount)
    INTO avg_sales_amount
    FROM artworks
    JOIN sales ON artworks.artwork_id = sales.artwork_id
    WHERE artworks.genre = genre;
    RETURN avg_sales_amount;
END;

SELECT averageSalesAmount('Impressionism') AS avg_sales_amount_impressionism;
```

- 3.Create a stored procedure to add a new sale and update the total sales for the artwork.
  Ensure the quantity is positive, and use transactions to maintain data integrity.

```sql

SYNTAX:CREATE PROCEDURE spnewSalesandUpdates()
AS
BEGIN
END
EXEC spnewSalesandUpdates
----------------------------------
CREATE PROCEDURE AddSaleAndUpdateTotal(@ artwork_id INT, @quantity INT, @total_amount DECIMAL(10,2))
BEGIN
    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
    BEGIN
        -- ROLLBACK IF ANY SQL STATEMENT FAILS
        ROLLBACK;
    END;
    START TRANSACTION;
    IF quantity > 0 THEN
        INSERT INTO sales (artwork_id, sale_date, quantity, total_amount)
        VALUES (artwork_id, NOW(), quantity, total_amount);
        UPDATE artworks
        SET total_sales = total_sales + total_amount
        WHERE artwork_id = artwork_id;
    ELSE

CREATE FUNCTION totalQuantityPerGenre()
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(SELECT genre, SUM(quantity) as TotalQuantity
 FROM artworks
JOIN sales ON artworks.artwork_id = sales.artwork_id
GROUP BY genre);
SELECT * FROM totalQuantityPerGenre();
